				<h1>M.R.P.S.</h1>
				<p>I joined the Mahala residential Public School(M.R.P.S.) in LKG and attended it till I got to class 8th when we used to live in the GSS colony of Bhopatpura and later joined it again in class 12th to get dummy schooling.<br>
				1. LKG<br>
				Well my clasroom was the one in front of the tap water area on the ground floor in the wing where there was the staff-room.
				We sat on plastic chairs comfortable for kids.
				We generally played with toys, studied alphabets and numbers and used to sleep in the afternoon on the mats which were placed at the back under the windows.
				And that time I had a rude arts teacher cause she slept me when I draw a pot wrong(it was looking like a socks) that period was after we wake up from our afternoon nap and the bell was about to be banged.
				The babu who worked in office used to bang the bell at that time.
				The Bell was in front of the Staff Room and near the office
				Baiji used to help us to go to the washroom and spreads the mat(dari) we slept on.
				[I remember the scene of when she slapped me ;and an afternoon where I went to sleep ]<br>
				2. UKG<br>
				I don't remeber it quite well or it was similar to LKG I guess. [Those scene that I remembers could be of UKG]<br>
				3. 1st standard<br>
				Our class was the one to the next nearest to the tap water area we moved on to sitting on solid benches of iron and wood with a partner.
				One morning before we had to go to the assembly I was having an argument with a boy and I got really angry that I punched him in the face and he got a nose-bleed and my luck was so bad a strict teacher(Rajendra Sir) was going to the assembly from staff room and when he saw us he asked who did it and his slap knocked my senses out and when he said"Say sorry" I was like "Sorry"{in my mind "Get lost and never try to talk to me again"} then the teacher said quickly get to the assembly ground and he took the boy to wash his nose-bleed or something.
				I started to go to my sisters class to eat lunch together.<br>
